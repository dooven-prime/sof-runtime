*This paper is Paper XIV of the RIME program. It consumes sparse typed audit
signatures from Paper XIII and owns context- and policy-relative interpretation
and bounded candidate dispositions. Selection, authorization, outcome, and
effect remain downstream.*

## Abstract

**Problem.** An aligned SOF audit may contain nonzero coordinates, licensed
transformation differences, or unresolved coordinates. None carries action
meaning by itself. A direct map from mismatch counts to repair, rollback, or
deploy conflates semantic interpretation with policy.

**Approach.** Paper XIV introduces an explicit typed action object

$$
I_{\mathrm{interp}}
=
\operatorname{Interpret}
(\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}),
\qquad
A_{\mathrm{cand}}
=
\operatorname{Generate}(I_{\mathrm{interp}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}).
$$

$K_{\mathrm{ctx}}$ records actor, scope, objective, constraints, time,
authority, and uncertainty conditions. $\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}$ is a versioned
Policy Profile with applicability, rules, typed exceptions, and an explicit
precedence graph.
$I_{\mathrm{interp}}$ contains policy-relative Interpretation Records, and
$A_{\mathrm{cand}}$ contains bounded Candidate Actions. Missing context or an
inapplicable policy produces `NoDisposition`, an empty Candidate Action Set,
and no Interpretation Record or affirmative candidate.

**Results.** Four protocol propositions are stated: No Action Without Context and
Policy, Interpretation Relativity, Action Non-Fabrication, and Audit
Preservation. The controlled validation preserves the Paper XIII
projection, rejects
unresolved or undeclared coordinates as action support, binds every candidate
to audit coordinates, carrier, context, policy rules, preconditions,
declared risk considerations,
reversibility, evidence, and authorization state, and keeps selection
downstream. The controlled workbench validates 29 v2 objects: 28 migrated Paper
XIII records remain unresolved, while one native GridWorld F4 audit yields
only policy-relative review candidates.

**Implications.** Paper XIV does not provide a universal repair theorem, a
decision engine, or an action-effect certificate. It defines a reusable SOF
action object in which difference is interpreted only under explicit context
and policy. Causal effect estimation, feasibility, cost, authorization, and
final policy choice remain separate downstream problems.

## Introduction

Paper XIII associates an admissible SOF comparison object

$$
\mathfrak C_{\mathrm{cmp}}
=
(\mathcal R^\star,\widehat{\mathcal R},\Phi;\Theta)
$$

with a sparse typed audit signature

$$
\operatorname{Compare}(\mathfrak C_{\mathrm{cmp}})
=
\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}}.
$$

The comparison signature answers how two aligned reports differ. It does not
answer whether that difference is a defect, whether intervention is justified,
or which operational choice should be made. These questions require information
that is absent from the signature coordinates themselves.

The decisive counterexample is a conforming transformation. Relocating an
obstacle, retiming a traffic controller, or applying a declared compiler pass
can produce nonzero support, bridge, depth, response, or wall-record differences
while satisfying every transformation invariant. The same numerical pattern
that indicates failure under one comparison role may indicate licensed change
under another. Therefore

$$
\text{difference}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{defect}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{severity}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{action}.
$$

This paper makes four contributions.

1. It defines the typed objects $K_{\mathrm{ctx}}$, $\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}$,
   $I_{\mathrm{interp}}$, and $A_{\mathrm{cand}}$.
2. It states No Action Without Context and Policy and Interpretation Relativity.
3. It states Action Non-Fabrication and Audit Preservation as executable
   invariants.
4. It provides a schema, validator, hostile fixtures, and a controlled
   workbench whose unresolved inputs remain unresolved.

### Scope

The object studied here is semantic, not causal or optimal. An intended
diagnostic consequence records what a candidate is designed to change in a
subsequent audit; it is not an identified causal effect or a prediction. A
precondition records when a candidate would be meaningful; it is not a
feasibility proof. A Candidate Action Set records supported candidate
families; it is not an executed or selected plan.

## Notation Table

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|--------------------|
| $\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}}$ | immutable sparse typed audit projection consumed from Paper XIII |
| $K_{\mathrm{ctx}}$ | Paper XIV `ActionContext`, independently admitted and never derived from the audit |
| $\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}$ | Paper XIV `PolicyProfile`, the sole normative rule input in the v2 contract |
| $I_{\mathrm{interp}}$ | Paper XIV `InterpretationRecord` output relative to the admitted context and policy |
| $A_{\mathrm{cand}}$ | Paper XIV bounded `CandidateActionSet` output |
| `DispositionResult` | Paper XIV result class closing the interpretation and candidate sets |
| selected plan, authorization, outcome, and effect | downstream reserved contracts, not fields or conclusions of `.sofaction` |

The table names the objects owned by Paper XIV or consumed as typed inputs;
selection and external authority approval remain downstream contracts.

## Related Work and Novelty Boundary

**Program interfaces.** Paper X supplies capability-aware compilation and
evidence gating, Paper XI supplies typed wall records, Paper XII supplies the
single-report protocol, and Paper XIII supplies explicit aligned comparison
objects \cite{paper10,paper11,paper12,paper13}. Paper XIV consumes the sparse
audit projection from Paper XIII; it does not revise report admission,
alignment, wall ownership, or compiler soundness.

### Causal Intervention

Structural causal models distinguish observational association from
interventional claims and provide identification criteria for causal effects
\cite{pearl1995causal}. Paper XIV does not identify effects of its candidate
actions. Its intended-diagnostic-consequence fields are targets conditional on
declared preconditions. A causal model would be an additional domain-specific
input required before counterfactual or intervention-effect claims could be
made.

### Model-Based Diagnosis

Reiter's diagnosis theory computes diagnoses from a system description and
observations that conflict with intended behavior \cite{reiter1987diagnosis}.
Paper XIV shares the insistence that discrepancy alone is insufficient, but it
does not infer minimal faulty component sets. It interprets typed SOF audit
coordinates relative to an explicit comparison context and emits candidate
families rather than diagnoses.

### Action Languages and Planning

STRIPS represents actions through state-transforming operators, while later
action-language work formalizes descriptions of action effects
\cite{fikes1971strips,gelfond1998action}. Paper XIV borrows the discipline of
explicit targets, preconditions, effects, and limitations. It does not solve a
planning problem, define executable transition semantics, or claim closure and
composition laws for an Action Algebra.

### Decision and Policy Separation

Classical decision theory and dynamic programming formalize preferences,
constraints, consequences, and sequential policy choice
\cite{savage1954foundations,bellman1957dynamic}. Those theories clarify why
policy is an explicit normative input to interpretation, while selection and
authorization remain downstream. A policy rule may support a candidate without
making that candidate objectively correct.

**Novelty boundary.** Paper XIV contributes the context-indexed interpretation
interface, the closed Policy Predicate Language, uncertainty propagation, and
bounded candidate dispositions. It does not provide causal effect estimation,
feasibility, authorization, optimal selection, post-action observation, or an
Action Effect Certificate.

## Semantic Factorization

### Audit Signatures

Write the Paper XIII output as

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}}
=
(\Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_m).
$$

The signature contains the typed coordinates requested by the Paper
XIII Audit Profile. Legacy `action_response_failure` appears only in archived
v1 inputs; it is not an active Paper XIV intervention field.

### Action Context and Policy Profile

> **Definition (Action Context).** The Paper XIV context object is
> $$
> K_{\mathrm{ctx}}
> =
> (\mathrm{actor},\mathrm{scope},\mathrm{objective},\mathrm{constraints},
> \mathrm{time},\mathrm{authority},\mathrm{uncertainty}).
> $$
> It also retains the comparison role, mismatch direction, contract status, and
> a non-certifying evaluator-qualification note. The validator checks the
> audit identifier, reference-to-target direction, provenance-relative role,
> actor, and authority scope. These fields describe applicability and
> responsibility; they do not alter the audit or create a qualification
> certificate.

> **Definition (Policy Profile).** A versioned policy profile is
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> \Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}=(&\mathrm{id},\mathrm{contract\ version},
> \mathrm{revision},\mathrm{applicability},\\
> &\mathrm{rules},\mathrm{exceptions},\mathrm{precedence\ edges}).
> \end{aligned}
> $$
> A policy profile supplies normative basis, uncertainty handling, candidate
> dispositions, and rule precedence. It does not become a ground-truth oracle
> and does not select or authorize an action merely by matching a rule.

The admission contract treats both objects independently. Admission separates
contract validation, applicability, and completeness. A missing field or
unsupported contract is rejected as incomplete; a valid but inapplicable
policy is recorded separately as not applicable. Either state stops
interpretation. Absence of context or policy is therefore not evidence of
failure.

### Policy Predicate Language

Paper XIV v2 freezes Policy Predicate Language v1.0 as a closed, recursively
typed expression language. Boolean nodes are `all`, `any`, and `not`. Leaf
nodes are limited to coordinate existence, state, carrier, and relation;
comparison role and contract status; authority and uncertainty status;
declared context-constraint status; transformation-contract presence; and
policy-basis presence. The coordinate identifier `*` denotes only the current
coordinate in the per-coordinate interpreter. It is not a dynamic field path.

Predicates cannot execute code, query a network, inspect undeclared fields, or
infer a condition from free text. `UNRESOLVED`, `NOT_DECLARED`,
`INCOMPARABLE`, and `NOT_APPLICABLE` remain explicit states; none is coerced to
false or zero. A typed exception has its own predicate and an explicit set of
rules that it suppresses. `precedence_edges` is the sole precedence source. If
several active rules match and no one rule precedes all other matches, the
interpreter emits `policy_conflict` rather than selecting by declaration order.
Deterministic replay re-executes the predicate tree and recomputes the
selected rule and assessment kind from the frozen audit, context, and policy.
Uncertainty handling is itself a versioned machine object, not a free-text
instruction. Policy Predicate Language v1.0 uses
$\mathbb T_3=\{\mathrm{TRUE},\mathrm{FALSE},\mathrm{UNRESOLVED}\}$ with
$\neg U=U$, $T\wedge U=U$, $F\wedge U=F$, $T\vee U=T$, and
$F\vee U=U$. The `uncertainty_policy` object fixes unavailable-coordinate,
`NOT_DECLARED`, incomparable, conflict, and no-applicable-rule behavior. Thus
deterministic replay is claimed only for the same normalized
$(\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}})$ and the same
interpreter/profile version closure.

### Interpretation Records

> **Definition (Interpretation Record).** An interpretation record is
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> I_{\mathrm{interp}}=(&\mathrm{audit\ coordinate\ refs},\ \mathrm{context\ refs},\\
> &\mathrm{policy\ rule\ refs},\ \mathrm{assessment},\\
> &\mathrm{uncertainty},\ \mathrm{negative\ boundary}).
> \end{aligned}
> $$
> It may describe licensed change, a defect candidate, no action indicated, or
> an inconclusive state. It never rewrites the source coordinate or promotes
> `UNRESOLVED`, `NOT_DECLARED`, or a declared baseline into a defect.

Severity, confidence, and assessment are policy- and context-relative. They
are not intrinsic magnitudes of $\Delta_i$. Every record retains the source
coordinate state, the context identifier, the applicable policy rules, and its
negative boundary.

### Candidate Actions

> **Definition (Candidate Action).** A candidate action is
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> A_{\mathrm{cand}}=(&\mathrm{id},\ \mathrm{preconditions},\\
> &\mathrm{intended\ diagnostic\ consequence},\\
> &\mathrm{declared\ risk\ considerations},\ \mathrm{reversibility},\\
> &\mathrm{evidence\ refs},\ \mathrm{authorization\ state}).
> \end{aligned}
> $$
> Each candidate also carries its disposition, target coordinate, context
> reference, policy-rule references, and negative boundary. The disposition
> type is the explicit sum
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> \mathrm{CandidateActionKind}=\;&\mathrm{Investigate}
> \sqcup\mathrm{RequestEvidence}\sqcup\mathrm{Mitigate}\\
> &\sqcup\mathrm{Rollback}\sqcup\mathrm{Escalate}.
> \end{aligned}
> $$
>
> The result layer is separate:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
> \mathrm{DispositionResult}=\;&\mathrm{NoDisposition}
> \sqcup\mathrm{UnresolvedDisposition}\\
> &\sqcup\mathrm{NoActionDisposition}
> \sqcup\mathrm{CandidateActionSet}.
> \end{aligned}
> $$
> An empty Candidate Action Set is not itself `NoAction`:
> `NoDisposition`
> means that no legal disposition was formed, `UnresolvedDisposition` means
> that admitted inputs remain insufficient, and `NoActionDisposition` is an
> explicit policy-supported disposition.

These are reusable types, not a universal operational vocabulary. A candidate
is not an execution command, a recommendation, a feasibility proof, a causal
effect, or an authorization receipt. The v2 contract permits candidates to record
`not_requested`, `required`, `pending`, or `denied`; they cannot declare
themselves authorized. Authorization is reserved for a future external
`.sofauth` contract.

### The Executable Factorization

The canonical Paper XIV object is

$$
\boxed{
\mathrm{SOFActionObject}
=
(\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}},
I_{\mathrm{interp}},A_{\mathrm{cand}})
}
$$

with the admitted-input construction

$$
I_{\mathrm{interp}}
=
\operatorname{Interpret}
(\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}),
\qquad
A_{\mathrm{cand}}
=
\operatorname{Generate}(I_{\mathrm{interp}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}).
$$

The ActionContext and PolicyProfile are independent admitted inputs; neither is
derived from the audit signature. The action generator accepts Interpretation
Records and an admitted Policy Profile; it rejects a raw SOFAUDIT payload.
Every candidate stores the audit coordinate, carrier, context, policy rule,
preconditions, declared risk considerations, reversibility, evidence
references, and authorization state that support it.

The v2 contract claims phase separation, not a fully split semantic
rulebook and action-generation profile. The same admitted `PolicyProfile` is
therefore carried into both phases: `Interpret` evaluates its predicate and
precedence semantics, while `Generate` uses the resulting rule references and
allowed disposition closure to bind candidates. `Generate` does not re-interpret
the audit or select an action. A future split into a semantic `Rulebook` and a
candidate-generation profile is a Research Program item, not a property of the
v2 artifact contract.

## Core Propositions

> **Proposition (No Action Without Context and Policy).** There is no admitted
> Paper XIV mapping $\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}}\mapsto A_{\mathrm{cand}}$ in the
> absence of an admitted $K_{\mathrm{ctx}}$ and an applicable
> $\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}$. The permitted construction is
> $$
> I_{\mathrm{interp}}
> =\operatorname{Interpret}
> (\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}),
> \qquad
> A_{\mathrm{cand}}
> =\operatorname{Generate}(I_{\mathrm{interp}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}).
> $$

**Proof.** The Action Object contract requires context and policy admission
before an Interpretation Record can be emitted. The candidate validator
requires each candidate to reference both objects. A missing or inapplicable
input therefore yields `NoDisposition` and an empty Candidate Action Set rather
than a default action.
$\square$

> **Proposition (Interpretation Relativity).** For one retained audit signature,
> two admitted policy/context pairs may produce different but valid
> interpretation records:
> $$
> I_{K_1,\Pi_1}(\Delta)\neq I_{K_2,\Pi_2}(\Delta).
> $$
> This is a change in normative input, not an instability of the interpreter.

**Proof.** The rule precedence and applicability fields are part of the input
to interpretation. A conforming transformation may be assessed as
`licensed_change`, while the same active coordinate under a failure-control
context may be assessed as a `defect_candidate`. Both records preserve the same
audit coordinate and cite their own context and policy rule. $\square$

> **Proposition (Action Non-Fabrication).** Every generated candidate action
> references at least one retained audit coordinate, one admitted context, and
> one applicable policy rule. It also records preconditions, intended
> diagnostic consequence, declared risk considerations, reversibility,
> evidence references, authorization
> state, and a negative boundary. No candidate is generated from a missing,
> `UNRESOLVED`, or `NOT_DECLARED` coordinate alone.

> **Proposition (Audit Preservation).** For every valid
> $S=(\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}},
> I_{\mathrm{interp}},A_{\mathrm{cand}})$,
> $$
> \operatorname{AuditProjection}(S)=\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}}.
> $$
> Interpretation and candidate generation may add references and bounded
> semantic fields, but may not rewrite comparison state, reference authority,
> evidence level, or source provenance.

**Proof.** The v2 artifact embeds the sparse Paper XIII coordinate projection,
binds the source audit and its Paper XIII validation receipt by SHA-256, and
compares decoded projections for structural equality. Canonical JSON encoding
then gives a distinct artifact-level byte comparison; these two equality
checks are not conflated. Candidate support is checked against the same
coordinate IDs, carriers, and states. $\square$

![Context and policy relativity. One raw signature can be interpreted as a
reference violation under one admitted context and as licensed change under a
conforming transformation contract. The audit projection remains unchanged.](../../figures/paper14/fig2_context_nonidentifiability.png)

The controlled transformation fixtures instantiate Interpretation Relativity,
while the native GridWorld F4 chain supplies a factual v2 input. The 28
migrated Paper XIII records remain unresolved and therefore do not supply
affirmative candidates. The resulting boundary is:

$$
\text{difference}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{defect}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{severity}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{action}.
$$

## Candidate Action Sets

### Structured Candidates

The candidate set is generated only from admitted Interpretation Records:

$$
A_{\mathrm{cand}}
=
\bigcup_{i\ \mathrm{admitted}}
\operatorname{Generate}_{K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}}}(I_{\mathrm{interp},i}).
$$

It may be empty. The controlled workbench uses only `Investigate` and
`RequestEvidence` for the native factual GridWorld F4 mismatch. Explicit
`NoActionDisposition`, `UnresolvedDisposition`, and `NoDisposition` remain
distinct from the Candidate Action Set. No domain is required to implement
every CandidateActionKind.

> **Protocol Invariant (Action Non-Fabrication).** A candidate produced by the
> v2 generator cites an audit coordinate, an admitted ActionContext, and an
> applicable PolicyProfile rule. It does not cite an unresolved coordinate as
> affirmative support, and it does not contain an execution command or an
> unverified causal effect.

The invariant is a contract property for the declared policy profile. It does
not show that a candidate is feasible, causally effective, safe, authorized, or
optimal. Those require external domain models and downstream governance.

### Typed Channel Semantics

Word and Lie bridge channels remain distinct throughout the factorization. A
word discrepancy supports composition-path candidates; a Lie discrepancy
supports commutator-channel candidates. The generator does not collapse them
into a generic bridge score.

![Typed coordinate semantics. Direct support, word bridges, Lie bridges,
frozen depth, and wall records retain distinct meanings and candidate families
through semantic interpretation and action generation.](../../figures/paper14/fig4_channel_semantics.png)

The GridWorld F4 control provides a strict implementation witness: a Lie-channel
difference generates a Lie-carrier candidate without a word-bridge insertion
candidate. This is compatible with the static word/Lie carrier separation owned
by Paper VIII and preserved by Paper XIII's aligned comparison contract; it is
not a universal claim that every domain realizes both channels.

### Empty and Inconclusive Cases

![Semantic admission and empty-set boundary. Missing context and admitted zero
signatures both produce empty Action Sets. No default retain, deploy, or rollback
decision is generated.](../../figures/paper14/fig6_admission_boundary.png)

Three result states are distinguished.

1. `NoDisposition` means that no legal disposition was formed, including when
   context or policy admission stops the chain or no coordinates are retained.
2. `UnresolvedDisposition` means that context and policy were admitted but
   unresolved, not-declared, incomparable, or not-applicable coordinates block
   affirmative disposition.
3. `NoActionDisposition` means that the applicable policy explicitly supports
   no action. It is not an empty set accidentally interpreted as safety.

An admitted active signature may instead produce a nonempty Candidate Action
Set. Empty output has no universal safety meaning; its result kind records why
no candidate action was formed.

## The SOF Action Contract

The canonical machine-readable contract is the versioned SOFAction v2 schema
(Artifact A1). Its principal fields are:

| Field | Role |
|-------|------|
| Source audit / projection | immutable Paper XIII source and validation-receipt references plus preserved coordinate map |
| Action context | explicit actor, scope, objective, constraints, time, authority, and uncertainty |
| Policy profile | contract version, policy revision, source-addressed normative basis, typed predicates and exceptions, and precedence edges |
| Interpretations | coordinate, context, and policy references with assessment and negative boundary |
| Candidate set | zero or more bounded CandidateAction records |
| Disposition result | explicit `NoDisposition`, `UnresolvedDisposition`, `NoActionDisposition`, or Candidate Action Set state |
| Record class / basis | v2 policy-conformance or decision-trace class with source-addressed protocol basis |
| Failure modes | non-implication, applicability, and epistemic boundaries |

The schema is closed: unknown predicate, context, policy, interpretation, and
candidate fields are rejected, and normative evidence cannot be a bare string.
Semantic conformance additionally requires source-receipt and digest closure,
exact Audit Projection preservation, context and policy admission,
deterministic predicate and precedence replay, interpretation and candidate
closure, authority-scope closure, and disposition consistency. Appendix A
indexes the corresponding executable controls.

The `.sofaction` v2 contract has only two record classes:

| Class | What it can establish | What it cannot establish |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Policy Conformance Certificate | typed policy predicates were applied under the declared contract and revision | policy validity or action correctness |
| Decision Trace Certificate | audit, context, policy, interpretation, and candidate links are complete | feasibility, safety, causal effect, authorization, or optimality |

Four related concepts remain reserved for separate contracts rather than
labels inside `.sofaction`: `.sofplan` for a selected plan, `.sofauth` for an
authorization receipt, `.sofoutcome` for a post-action observation, and
`.sofeffect` for an independently validated intervention effect. In particular,
an Outcome Observation cannot be relabelled as an Action Effect Certificate,
and an authorization receipt is not a scientific evidence level.

Canonical `.sofaction` artifacts stop at the Candidate Action Set. An optional
selector consumes that set and emits a separate downstream plan artifact; it
cannot modify the audit projection, interpretations, or candidate set:

$$
\pi:\mathsf{ActionSet}\times\mathsf{PolicyContext}\to
\mathsf{SelectedActionPlan}.
$$

Policy may encode cost, safety requirements, authorization, deployment stage,
or service objectives, but matching a policy rule does not make a candidate
objectively correct. These quantities are not coordinates of the Paper XIII
audit projection.

### Claim Spine

Definitions and negative ownership boundaries are not additional
reader-facing evidence levels. Certificate classes identify what a finite
validation establishes; they do not promote policy correctness or candidate
effectiveness.

| Object or conclusion | Formal role and claim target | Reader-facing status |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `SOFActionObject`, `ActionContext`, `PolicyProfile`, `InterpretationRecord`, and `DispositionResult` | owned type definitions; representation interface | not an independent evidence claim |
| No Action Without Context and Policy | domain-of-definition proposition; representation interface | Theorem |
| Interpretation Relativity | context/policy-relative proposition; bounded fixtures provide a controlled witness | Theorem |
| Action Non-Fabrication and Audit Preservation | exact representation-interface propositions under the v2 contract | Theorem |
| Versioned Predicate Replay | finite protocol-conformance replay under one normalized input and version closure; not policy correctness | Computational Certificate |
| 29-object workbench | finite schema and semantic validation; Policy Conformance / Decision Trace Certificate | Computational Certificate |
| Native GridWorld F4 candidates | policy-relative bounded outputs; no feasibility, authorization, selection, or effect claim | Computational Observation |
| action effectiveness and optimal selection | open downstream problems reserved for external contracts | Research Program |

Generation of an `Investigate` candidate therefore does not establish that
investigation is the correct action. A protocol trace proves closure of the
declared inputs and links, not scientific adequacy, causal effect, feasibility,
safety, or authorization.

## Controlled Validation

The controlled v2 workbench consumes 28 migrated Paper XIII SOFAUDIT records and
one native GridWorld F4 factual audit. All 29 retain an exact audit projection,
an explicit ActionContext, and an applicable PolicyProfile. The migrated
records contain only unresolved or not-declared coordinate states and therefore
produce no affirmative candidates. The native F4 record produces only
`Investigate` and `RequestEvidence` candidates under the declared review
policy.

![Controlled semantic workbench. The workbench distinguishes migrated
unresolved inputs from the native factual GridWorld F4 trace. Candidate counts
describe policy-relative coverage, not defect severity or system quality.](../../figures/paper14/fig5_controlled_workbench.png)

Representative controls are summarized below.

| Case | Active semantic pattern | Derived boundary |
|------|-------------------------|------------------|
| 28 migrated records | unresolved or not-declared coordinates | inconclusive interpretation; no candidate action |
| Native GridWorld F4 | certified simple-commutator mismatch with aligned support channels | investigation and evidence request only |
| Hostile policy fixtures | malformed rules, projection rewrite, unresolved support, carrier or authority substitution | validator rejection |

The counts are not quality or severity scores. They report the result of a
declared policy over the declared evidence states. Candidate feasibility,
authorization, causal effect, and safety are not tested by this workbench.

## Claim Boundary

Paper XIV establishes the typed Action Object and four protocol propositions.
It does not claim:

- a universal repair theorem,
- causal identification of candidate effects,
- domain-independent feasibility,
- a universal or complete action vocabulary,
- cost, risk, or authorization calibration,
- optimal policy selection,
- that a policy rule match makes a candidate objectively correct,
- an Action Effect Certificate under the `.sofaction` contract,
- that contract conformance proves system correctness,
- or composition, conflict, identity, and closure laws for an Action Algebra.

The workbench is controlled methodological evidence. Production use requires
domain intervention models, authorization, causal or empirical validation, and
post-intervention measurement.

## Relation to Papers XII and XIII

The protocol boundary is now:

| Paper | Mathematical object | Artifact | Question |
|-------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| XII | single-system diagnostic report | .sofreport | What was measured? |
| XIII | aligned comparison object and factual signature | .sofaudit | How do two reports differ? |
| XIV | `SOFActionObject = (Delta_audit, K_ctx, Pi_policy, I_interp, A_cand)` | .sofaction | Under which context and policy can a difference be interpreted and which bounded candidates are supported? |
| Downstream policy | objective-relative selector | reserved .sofplan | Which candidate should be chosen? |

This separation allows the same factual audit record to be interpreted under
different admissible contexts or policies without rewriting Paper XIII
evidence. It does not turn the selected reference into ground truth.

## Outlook

Several extensions remain open.

1. Add domain-specific policy profiles and test their authority and exception
   semantics under the frozen predicate language.
2. Define action compatibility, conflict, composition, identity, and
   equivalence before introducing Action Algebra terminology.
3. Add domain causal models that can turn intended diagnostic consequences
   into testable intervention predictions.
4. Study minimal candidate sets and residual-signature prediction without
   conflating either problem with policy optimality.
5. Develop longitudinal records in which post-intervention SOF Reports close
   the measurement loop without rewriting the original audit.

## Conclusion

Paper XIV fixes the semantic object between comparison and any downstream
disposition:

$$
\mathrm{SOFActionObject}
=
(\Delta_{\mathrm{audit}},K_{\mathrm{ctx}},\Pi_{\mathrm{policy}},
I_{\mathrm{interp}},A_{\mathrm{cand}}).
$$

The central boundary is

$$
\text{difference}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{defect}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{severity}
\not\Rightarrow
\text{action}.
$$

An audit is preserved, context and policy are explicit, interpretation is
relative to those inputs, and candidates remain bounded records rather than
execution commands. This is the stable interface required before SOF
diagnostics can participate in intervention workflows.

## Appendix A: Computational Artifacts

### A.1 Contract and Reference Implementation

The following source-addressed artifacts implement or validate the v2
`.sofaction` contract. The schema is the normative machine-readable shape;
the engine, workbench, and validator are reference implementations and
evidence producers, not semantic authorities.

| Artifact | Role | Source-addressed path |
|----------|------|-----------------------|
| A1 | SOFActionObject schema and record-class contract | `schemas/sofaction/v2.0.schema.json` |
| A2 | ActionContext/PolicyProfile admission, interpretation, and candidate engine | `experiments/paper14/action_engine.py` |
| A3 | controlled 29-object workbench | `experiments/paper14/action_workbench.py` |
| A4 | semantic validator and receipt producer | `experiments/paper14/validate_sofaction.py` |
| A5 | optional downstream selector; excluded from canonical `.sofaction` evidence | `experiments/paper14/policy_selector.py` |
| A6 | generated v2 action artifacts and validation receipts | `experiments/paper14/results/` |
| A7 | focused hostile tests and checked-artifact/receipt closure | `tests/test_sof_action.py`; `tests/test_sofaction_v2.py` |

Validation checks include schema closure, source digest closure, exact Audit
Projection preservation, Paper XIII validation-receipt binding, context and
policy admission, policy applicability, independent predicate replay,
precedence graph acyclicity, typed exception coverage, one-to-one coordinate
interpretation coverage, hostile unresolved support rejection, candidate-to-
interpretation and carrier references, authority actor/scope closure, and
canonical omission of downstream selection.

### A.2 Experimental Reproduction

The workbench reads the 28 migrated Paper XIII audits plus the native
GridWorld F4 audit and regenerates 29 v2 Action Objects. The runnable
reproduction entry points are indexed in `experiments/paper14/README.md`.
Figures summarize the formal factorization and controlled outputs; they are not
independent evidence.

### A.3 Boundary Controls

The automated controls include:

- rejection of raw audit payloads by the candidate generator;
- policy/context relativity witnesses on one native audit;
- exact Audit Projection preservation;
- rejection of unknown policy rules and inapplicable profiles;
- rejection of arbitrary predicate nodes, bare evidence strings, and forged
  interpretation assessments;
- rejection of dispositions supported by `UNRESOLVED` coordinates;
- rejection of precedence cycles, conflicting rules, and uncovered exceptions;
- rejection of wrong carriers, out-of-scope actors, attempts to self-declare
  `authorized`, and selector IDs outside a Candidate Set;
- explicit inconclusive output for missing context or policy;
- and omission of policy selection and post-action observations from canonical
  workbench artifacts.

These controls establish implementation fidelity to the formal interface. They
do not establish domain intervention effectiveness. A1--A7 establish only
their declared schema, protocol-conformance, replay, and bounded-output
targets; they do not establish policy correctness, feasibility, authorization,
selection, post-action outcome, or causal effect. Full generated paths and
digests are indexed in `experiments/paper14/README.md`; all listed artifacts are
available in the [RIME repository](https://github.com/dooven-prime/rime-lite).
